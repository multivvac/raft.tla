--------------------------- MODULE raftVariables ---------------------------

EXTENDS raftConstants

\* Global variables

\* A bag of records representing requests and responses sent from one server
\* to another. This is a function mapping Message to Nat.
VARIABLE messages

\* Counter for how many times each server has become leader
VARIABLE leaderCount

\* maximum client requests so far
VARIABLE maxc

\* variable for tracking entry commit message counts
\* Maps <<logIndex, logTerm>> to a record tracking message counts.
\* [ sentCount |-> Nat,   \* AppendEntriesRequests sent for this entry
\*   ackCount  |-> Nat,   \* Successful AppendEntriesResponses received for this entry
\*   committed |-> Bool ] \* Flag indicating if the entry is committed
VARIABLE entryCommitStats

instrumentationVars == <<leaderCount, maxc, entryCommitStats>>

\* The following variables are all per server (functions with domain Server).

\* The server's term number.
VARIABLE currentTerm
\* The server's state (Follower, Candidate, or Leader).
VARIABLE state
\* The candidate the server voted for in its current term, or
\* Nil if it hasn't voted for any.
VARIABLE votedFor
serverVars == <<currentTerm, state, votedFor>>

\* A Sequence of log entries. The index into this sequence is the index of the
\* log entry. Unfortunately, the Sequence module defines Head(s) as the entry
\* with index 1, so be careful not to use that!
VARIABLE log
\* The index of the latest entry in the log the state machine may apply.
VARIABLE commitIndex
logVars == <<log, commitIndex>>

\* The following variables are used only on candidates:
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a RequestVote
\* response in its currentTerm.
VARIABLE votesResponded
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a vote in its
\* currentTerm.
VARIABLE votesGranted
\* A history variable used in the proof. This would not be present in an
\* implementation.
\* Function from each server that voted for this candidate in its currentTerm
\* to that voter's log.
VARIABLE voterLog
candidateVars == <<votesResponded, votesGranted, voterLog>>

\* The following variables are used only on leaders:
\* The next entry to send to each follower.
VARIABLE nextIndex
\* The latest entry that each follower has acknowledged is the same as the
\* leader's. This is used to calculate commitIndex on the leader.
VARIABLE matchIndex
leaderVars == <<nextIndex, matchIndex>>

\* All variables; used for stuttering (asserting state hasn't changed).
vars == <<messages, serverVars, candidateVars, leaderVars, logVars, instrumentationVars>>
